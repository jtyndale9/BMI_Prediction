# BMI_Prediction
BMI values were predicted using the PIMA Indians dataset using linear regression and gradient descent.
Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database

The steps taken were as follows:
1. Load the data
2. Clean the dataset (seting target value, setting features, addressing missing values, and correcting types)
3. Normalize the data
4. Split the dataset into an 80% training and 20% testing set
5. Define an error calculation method
6. Define a gradient descent method
7. Define a MSE method (mean squared error)
8. Define a prediction method (dot product of weights and features)
9. Train the model using the methods defined above
10. Predict and tune the model
